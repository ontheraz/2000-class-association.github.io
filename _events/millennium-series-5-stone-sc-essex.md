Stone Sailing Club is a small and friendly place to sail, situated on the south bank of the River Blackwater in Essex close to Maldon and Burnham-on-Crouch. The river is some 2km wide at high tide and racing can be held at any state of the tide.

There is space for camping on site or there are a number of local campsites within a short walk or car journey.

The 2019 event became legendary with fantastic entertainment put on by the club.
