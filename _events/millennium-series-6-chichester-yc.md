This club has fantastic facilities and racing is immediately off the club lawn, so is great for spectators. Start times vary depending on tides so keep an eye open for the Notice of Race. Racing is on sheltered flat water, although the tides make for interesting race strategy. Excellent food options at the club and local marina.
