Due to Lockdown 3 we're extending the time limit for entries to the Nationals to be entered into the draw for a FREE ENTRY !

So what you have to do is enter and pay £40 by Sunday 28th February 2021. On 1st March - around lunchtime - a draw will be made and the winner gets an entry to the 2021 Nationals and their £40 refunded.

Going to the Nationals at the excellent Royal Torbay Yacht Club in Torquay is certainly one the of surest ways you can have fun in 2021 , so don't delay getting your entry in - in an average year we'd expect 50+ boats to enter; in the face of car ferry jams, limits on places to go abroad for your holidays thanks to covid, and the testing procedures that you may have to undergo and the expense of those tests, we're expecting a high number to opt to stay in the UK.

Bear in mind also that as one of the few dinghy classes to run a proper championship and open meetings in 2020 there's been a steady upturn in people looking to acquire their first 2000.

Enter now and get something in your diary you can start to look forward to!

Kind regards,

Kev.
