Millennium Series 4 - Thorney Island SC.

13th January 2021 :: 

Apologies to all those who have booked time in their 2021 calendar, but we have had to change the date of the Thorney Island SC Millennium event

OLD DATE            10 - 11 July 

NEW DATE            24 -25 July

The change is due to a clash with another local event that would have created issues.
