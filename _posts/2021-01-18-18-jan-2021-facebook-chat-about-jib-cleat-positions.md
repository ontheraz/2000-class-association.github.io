A member is asking:

Hi, I am after some tech advice re changing my jib sheet cleats and riser wedges. The old class website has a tech blog, but I do not appear to be able to find it. Does it still exist? If not can anyone advise on best cleat / wedge set up.

I currently have Holt Allen 676 cleats with a HA 893 wedge which I believes gives a 7 Degree lift. (I believe original set up on 22235). I am looking at Harken 150 cleats with a 15 degree wedge part nos H294. Is this the way to go to keep my crew happy to cleat off easier esp when out hiking?

As with what Chris has said, the cleat height is all down to the crews preference and technique. The higher the cleat is angled, the easier the crew will be able to uncleat it. the downside to this is that it can be harder to uncleat it when hiking. A good angled would be to run the sheet across the boat to the windward side in the gunwale and the sheet perfectly cleated. This mean it wont wake much for the crew to cuncleat it in maneuver or gust but easy enough to cleat normally or with the outside of the foot on-top of the sheet. Hard to explain by text but I hope you get the gist of what I mean.

Having the cleat too low is blinking awkward. Having the cleat too high is down right dangerous! Not being able to uncleat when you need to means the crew wont have the confidence to pull the jib in tight and cleat it when needed.

  
**Chris Jordan:** One of my articles from 10 or 12 years ago for the Millennium Mutterings said:

Jib sheet cleats:

Get the angle of the cleats correct: Laser seem to expect the crew to be sitting sedately on the thwart, not sitting out next to the shrouds. You will need to swing the cleats forward to allow them to be jammed easily when the crew is sitting out next to the shrouds. Also, you need to adjust them up and down (either with wedges under the cleats, or a big pair of mole grips and bend the plate) to ensure the crew can both jamb the jib, AND release it quickly when required.

The fore-aft position of the cleats: some people say they should be further back in strong winds, to allow the slot to open up automatically. Others say that raking the mast back a little will achieve the same effect. Both are correct: but we just leave them in the same position (one hole forward from right at the back) for all weathers.

We have just upgraded to the harken 150 with the 15 degree wedge. Find it works well for us. Like everyone is saying though it is what works best for you as not being able to uncleat is a real possibility with too much upwards angle. Biggest improvement we found was angling the cleats forward as Chris says, when we bought ours they were angled to face the thwart which was the main challenge for getting the jib cleated when at the shroud.
