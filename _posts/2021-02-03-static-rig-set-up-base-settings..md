Ensure the shroud T terminals are in the bottom holes as pictured, the higher holes are for the optional Trapezing kit wires (trapezing isn’t permitted for racing)

**Spreader Length and Angle**

Spreader length: Measured tip to tip to the centre of the shroud wire, the measurement is 860mm.

![](/uploads/2021/02/03/5.jpg)The whipping twine is simply tied onto the shrouds and pulled tight and is just there for the purpose of measuring remove it after measuring. The measurement is between 170 - 180 mm

**TO SET THE BOAT UP YOU MUST PUT JIB UP WITH THE CORRECT RIG TENSION ON**

**Rig Tension**

Measured at shoulder height on the shroud using a rig tension meter 330lbs or 150kg

Firstly, tie the halyard to a long tape measure (it needs to longer then 7m) using the bobble method. Raise the halyard up to the top of the mast, then tension the halyard ensuring it is at the top. Now read the tape measure off at the goose neck it should read 5. 23m.

We do this every time before we measure the mast rake to ensure the halyard is in the same place every time. Put simply, it ensures consistency every time we pull the halyard up. If it measures 5.23m we know we have the correct starting point before then measuring the mast rake.

Having checked the halyard datum, swing the tape measure to back of the boat and read off the number it should read 6560mm

Top tip avoid trying this in 25 knots of breeze as reading the numbers accurately is challenging!

If having done all the above correctly, you might not have the correct measurement of 6560mm, If this is the case then you will need to adjust the shroud clevis pins up or down on the chain plates (pictured below)

**Adjustment example**

One hole up or down is equal to 40mm + / -

One hole diagonally up or down is equal to 20mm + /-

Using the above adjustments, you will be a achieve the base measurement of 6560mm, if you can’t re trace your steps to chance the potential error.
