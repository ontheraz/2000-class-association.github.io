&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;West Country Boat Repairs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2000 Class have engaged with West Country Boat Repairs as their title sponsor for the 6 rounds of the Millennium Series in 2021. The Series will be 2 inland events and 4 sea rounds all in spectacular locations from Derbyshire in April down to Hampshire from April to September. In keeping with the ethos of the 2000s as friendly and serious racing in a boat that has everything the keen racer wants yet isn’t intimidating to the less experienced sailor, the programme next year gives opportunities for first time Open Event travellers at a large range of locations and in conditions likely to be manageable for the family sailors and sometimes challenging for the proficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“West Country Boat Repairs are delighted to be sponsoring the prestigious Millennium Series in 2021. We will be supplying a range of prizes including places on our Dinghy Repair workshops, a full 2000 refurbishment and plenty of our famous Ugly Mugs. We will have spot prizes as well as prizes for the overall winners, so there is a chance for everyone, whatever your level. We already know many of the 2000 sailors as valued customers and look forward to meeting the rest of the fleet during 2021. We know that there’s going to be at least one of the events that suits your location and experience so come and join in the fun; you may go home with a prize!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Millennium Series was taken in 2019 and 2020 by Simon Horsfield and Katie Burridge, the Sail Juice 2019 - 20 winners who’ve made a great start in the 20 -21 series, so the Millennium Series proves to be a great place to learn how to mix it with the top sailors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prizes available from West Country Boat Repairs include boat and foils overhauls, and days on WCBR’s boat repair courses at their workshops in Gloucestershire. There are also places on racing sailing training courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a great fit for the 2000 Class “said Mark Foley, 2000 Publicity Officer. “We are constantly dealing with people asking us where they can get their hands on a 2000, as they are snapped up when they come up for sale. So what better way to look after your boat’s resale value than get an upgrade courtesy of WCBR, or spend a day on a course learning how to keep your boat in tip top condition by yourself? Indeed, if you are not in the position to get a new boat from RS Sailing, when you see a boat for sale that needs some work, put yourself in touch with WCBR beforehand and have a chat about what the improvements you want might cost before you negotiate.”&lt;/p&gt;
